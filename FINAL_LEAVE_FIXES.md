# Leave Recommendation System - Final Fixes Applied

## üêõ **Issues Resolved**

- Removed undefined assignments from local state updates
- Added proper field filtering in both components

### 2. **Form Accessibility Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED

- Added ARIA attributes for radio button groups
- Implemented proper accessibility patterns
